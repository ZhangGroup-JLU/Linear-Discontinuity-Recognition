# Linear Discontinuity Recognition
YoloV8 implementation of the paper "Recognition of linear discontinuities on high-steep slope outcrops for typical hard rock masses in China based on high-precision UAV images trained by a deep learning model"

Our network takes a distorted underwater image as an input and procude the corresponding sharp estimate. The model we use is YoloV8 framework.
